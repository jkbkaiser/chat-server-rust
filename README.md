This is a simple implementation of both a chatclient and chatserver in rust.

To use either the client or server, first clone the repo:

```git clone git@github.com:Redjeepkaiser/chat-server-rust.git```

Server can be started with:

```cargo run --bin server```

Client can be started with:

```cargo run --bin client```
